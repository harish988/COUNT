Cashless Offline Universal NFC Transactions - A offline payment mobile application for common people

Our idea is to develop alternate payment solution for low-level merchants to make cashless digital payments by use of NFC technology. The core idea of our solution is to provide a payment transaction between merchant and customer through pre-programmed NFC tag and smart phone in offline mode.
 For this, we use pre-programmed NFC tag which interacts with NFC enabled mobile phone. The customer has to download the COUNT APP and link his account personally. The credit card will be validated using “Card Authorization API” online. The customer has to convert his cash to points which will be stored in his Offline Wallet.  A pre-programmed NFC tag which is exclusively made for merchant will be provided once the merchant links his bank account. The customer can pay his bill by interacting with NFC tag by placing his smartphone at a distance of 5-6 cm. The NFC tag will trigger an app in the customer’s smartphone in offline mode. Once the merchant’s NFC Tag is scanned, the merchant details containing Merchant’s unique ID and name will be displayed.The merchant has to enter amount to be paid inthe app. The transaction will be completed if the customer has the points to make the payment. The points will get transferred to Merchant’s NFC tag. The merchant can approach nearest bank to redeem his points to cash.
Our solution is very effective and convenient from the existing solution since COUNT doesn’t require any power source or cellular network for transaction. Moreover, the NFC tags are very cheap and can be easily programmed. The NFC transactions are very secure as compared to conventional transaction through QR code.
